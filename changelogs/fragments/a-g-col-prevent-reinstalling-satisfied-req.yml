bugfixes:
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy`` now considers all collection paths when identifying which collection requirements are already installed.
  Use the ``COLLECTIONS_PATHS`` and ``COLLECTIONS_SCAN_SYS_PATHS`` config options to modify these.
  Previously only the install path was considered when resolving the candidates.
  The install path will remain the only one potentially modified.
