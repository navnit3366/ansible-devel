bugfixes:
  - On Python 3 use datetime methods ``fromtimestamp`` and ``now`` with UTC timezone instead of ``utcfromtimestamp`` and ``utcnow``, which are deprecated in Python 3.12.
minor_changes:
  - Add ``utcfromtimestamp`` and ``utcnow`` to ``ansible.module_utils.compat.datetime`` to return fixed offset datetime objects.
